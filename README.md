# odin-recipes

This project creates a basic recipe website. The website consists of a main index page which has links to a few recipes. So far, this project just builds the HTML chops and will later style it up with CSS.

Skills demonstrated in this project include:
* Creating and cloning a git repository
* Adding files to the staging area and commits using git
* adding the boilerplate HTML
* html tags, elements and attributes
